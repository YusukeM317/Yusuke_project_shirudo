# GitHub badges in SVG format

See <https://github.com/h5bp/lazyweb-requests/issues/150>.

If you want to add a badge, only modify `badges.json`.

The format is the following:

```js
/* Unique name of your badge. */
"build-passed": {
  /* Textual information shown, in order. */
  "text": [ "build", "passed" ],
  "colorscheme": "green"
}
```

Color schemes are located at the bottom of the file. Each scheme has a name and
a [CSS/SVG color](http://www.w3.org/TR/SVG/types.html#DataTypeColor) for the
color used in the first box (for the first piece of text, field `colorA`) and
for the one used in the second box (field `colorB`).

```js
"green": {
  "colorB": "#4c1"
}
```

Both `colorA` and `colorB` have default values. Usually, the first box uses the
same dark grey, so you can rely on that default value by not
providing a `"colorA"` field (such as above).

You can also use the `"colorA"` and `"colorB"` fields directly in the badges if
you don't want to make a color scheme for it. In that case, remove the
`"colorscheme"` field altogether.
